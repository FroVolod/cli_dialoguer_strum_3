## User Guide

This guide is intended to give an elementary description of near-cli and an
overview of its capabilities. This guide assumes that near-cli is
[installed](README.md#installation)
and that readers have passing familiarity with using command line tools. This
also assumes a Unix-like system, although most commands are probably easily
translatable to any command line shell environment.
